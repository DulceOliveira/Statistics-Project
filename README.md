# Employee Satisfaction and Productivity Analysis

## Overview

This project explores the relationship between employee satisfaction and productivity within a company. 
The analysis employs statistical hypothesis testing to uncover insights that can help understand and improve workplace dynamics.


## Background

Understanding the factors that influence employee productivity is critical for any organization's success. 
Employee satisfaction is often cited as a key driver of productivity. In this project I try to determine if there
was a statistically significant relationship between employee satisfaction levels and their productivity.

## Hypothesis Testing

In this project, I formulated and tested some hypothesis.

- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**
